- Its better to create a TestHelper class for all the common functions that are used across all test classes
- Use @Findby notations to store locators in every test class
- You can use a TestNGListener class to create logs while testng tests' execution
- Do not use waitFor()(Thread.sleep) statements in the code unless absolutely necessary and try to handle it by implicit wait in @BeforeTest
- You can use the @BeforeClass testNG annotation to use Chrome Options to disable notifications to handle the popup asking permission to show notifications, initialize Chrome driver and setting implicit wait to set a wait across all elements
- Try Using @AfterClass to close the browser after every test
- There is a PageFactory class's initElements() function to initialize the Web Elements specified under @findby tag that can be used
- You need to use driver.switch to move to the modal window where the rest of the execution needs to happen
- Make sure you set the Release version to 11 to support JavaFX library that you use for PlatformUtil class
- Always Update Maven dependencies to latest versions
- To avoid NullPointerException, initialize the WebDriver using @BeforeTest or @BeforeClass annotation
- Regularly update the ChromeDriver.exe version to match your Chrome Browser version
